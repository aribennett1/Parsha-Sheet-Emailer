# Parsha-Sheet-Emailer
Google Apps Script code to get the current week's parsha, then emails the sheet from Google Drive.

The code is set up to be run on Tuesday.

I made this for parsha questions from R' Moshe Atik's Torah Teasers, which can be found [here](http://www.aish.com/tp/i/teasers/?s=bc) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Rabbi-Moshe-Atiks-Torah-Teasers/dp/1463791623).

Here is the Google Drive folder that I have: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ihDno5us7sLY6NH5fmqORPuplD8Uz_66
